**Timeline:** 

The timeline for this project has a date to be determined, estimated at January 13th. The poster campaign will have a deadline of January 5th. We are currently working out a time with Tech Town Detroit for the Cash is King conference. 


**Goals:**

The goals of this project are three fold. Firstly, a graphic design campaign done professionally including posters, flyers, banners and related media. Secondly, a cold pitch approach to inviting businesses will be used to garner support and interest. This includes visiting in person, and inviting them to the conference. At this time we will gather any questions they have, and find the answers before the conference. Thirdly, the conference will act as a launch point, with a presentation on what Bitcoin Cash is and what it can do for the businesses that choose to accept it. The question and answer session that follows will be prepared for, with proper answers, links, and support. 
This project aims to reach over 10,000 people directly, with participants showing up numbering between 150 and 200. The main focus will be on business implementation however I expect that due to the exposure, many individuals will come as well.

**Other:**

The information obtained from this project will be disseminated and used to create better and more effective conferences. Ideally, any Bitcoin Cash enthusiast should be able to obtain a copy of frequently the encountered questions and their answers from the conference. Networking businesses to a support circle is another aim. We will create a mailing list that every attendee can be linked to, regarding support and updates. Representing Bitcoin Cash accurately is important. Our conference be will recorded, and hopefully used as a template going forward.
