**FPR Id:**
0035

**Start Date:**
27/02/2018

**Hashtag:**

**Name of BCF Gitter community room:**

**Stakeholders:**
Edge/EdgeCloser

**Project Summary:**
A small truck that sports bright LED billboards on the sides and back that display the Bitcoin Cash logo. Also display some information to allow viewers/target audience to quickly access pertinent information to get them started with Bitcoin Cash. 

Drive the BCH LED billboard truck around the downtown core of Toronto on Canada Day (July 1st). This should create great publicity/marketing, increase awareness, and hopefully help spur adoption as a result. 

**Resources:**
LED digital advertising truck service

What to display on the LED billboard/screen and someone to create it

**Budget:**
Digital Advertising Services 

There are four mobile digital ad companies in Toronto: Wild On Media, Smart Outdoor Advertising, Accent Media Corp., and Northern Data. I have a rate quote from Wild On Media that I will assume is an average market price.

Rates for Wild On Media:
For advertising purposes $350/hour (minimum booking of 4 hours per day)
For Major Event participation (eg. Pride Parade, Canada Day or Marathons) its $500/hour (minimum booking of 4 hours per day)
For bookings longer than 48 hours we can offer you the Digital at $300 per hour for mass advertising and $400 per hour for major events. 

For a noon to 10pm (10 hours) advertising service on July 1st this would cost $5000 CAD. 

Funding would be needed in advance to book the date. Likely needed by June 1st at the latest. Would need an amount for a deposit earlier to secure that date as it will get booked early!


**Timeline:**
March/April/May - Setup relationship and book date with mobile advertising company and prepare digital materials for one day campaign

June 1st - Confirm with mobile digital advertising service and provide digital media. 

July 1st - Digital ads take to the streets!

**Goals:**
Want to reach as many people as possible, especially the younger crowd. Hopefully leave an impression on hundreds of thousands of individuals.

Downtown Toronto has two large universities and a few smaller colleges full of young individuals. 

I want to reach a younger audience as I believe they are less resistant to exploring new technology, more likely to adopt it, and more likely to see the potential practical applications of it. Young people also have larger social circles in which the idea can spread. 




**Other:**
The proposed date for marijuana legalization in Canada (July 1st) falls on Canada Day. However, there have been rumours that this legalization date may be delayed by up to 2 months. 

If legalization occurs on Canada Day then the young crowd will be out in the city streets in full participation of the festivities. 

Can probably figure out a better hashtag...not my forte.
