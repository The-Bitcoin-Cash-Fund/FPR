**Project Name:**
Bitcoin Cash Latte : Retail Experience

**FPR Id:**
0029

**Start Date:**
23/02/2018

**Hashtag:**
#BitcoinCashLatte

**Name of BCF Gitter community room:**
#proj-bitcoinCashLatteRetailExperience

**Stakeholders:**

- chaladni [ gord anderson : justgord on github and r/btc ] - software dev / CTO and founder of moosh.io
- dsignz at moosh.io



**Project Summary:**
The retail experience can be radically smoother, simpler and more enjoyable using BitcoinCash. 

BitcoinCashLatte will create a visual walk thru of the new kind of retail experience that is now possible with Bitcoin Cash as an underlying technology.  

Firstly it will walk thru the actual experience of a customer ordering food with friends at a sit-down cafe/restaurant. Then it will show the vendors perspective taking the order and getting paid.  It will explain the basic technology in a way that early adopters can relate to.  Then it will show how time and money can be saved, and how this approach results in better customer and vendor engagement for small retail businesses.


- Customer experience :

- walk into restau or cafe, sit down at table.. see a menu qrcode on the table
- scan qrcode, brings up menu on your smartphone
- order yummy food from menu, can pay right now or when food arrives
- food and drinks arrive, enjoy
- pay and optionally tip and review
- get specials &amp; loyalty points for next time

- Cafe owner / vendor experience :

- edit menu, change price/photo/descr
- get orders, see when they are paid, what table, what items
- print receipt
- handle tax tips etc
- view stats, what sells etc
- no expensive point-of-sale hardware, low fees compared to bank/cards.. 
- run your biz on tablet or smartphone


The website and video will act as a practical template on how retailers and small businesses can easily accept BitcoinCash, and how they can save time and money while engaging better with their customers.

**Resources:**

- code development expertise
- cafe owner participation
- filming, photography &amp; video editing
- graphic &amp; web design



**Budget:**

- storyboard, concept design, script, assets, menu data [ 1 week moosh dev staff : $1000 ]
- website, concept, menu &amp; graphic design [ 1 week moosh design staff $1000 ]
- code dev to support feature set [ browse menu, barcode, tips, daily reports export ]  [ 2 weeks moosh staff, unpaid ]
- Hire cafe and cafe owner [ 1 day setup + walkthru + filming :  $500 ]
- photography &amp; video editing [ 1 day onsite + postprod/editing ~ $1000 ]

total cost $3500

**Timeline:**

- 1 week : storyboard, scripts &amp; mockups + concept and graphic design for website and menu
- 2 weeks : Code development and prototyping
- 1 day cafe owner setup and walkthru
- 1 day filming and photography in an actual cafe
- 1 week : video and multimedia design, content, layout, editing, website creation
- 2 days : marketing and promotion

5 weeks project duration






**Goals:**

The first deliverable is a video and website that provides an ongoing promotion, aimed at retailers such as restaurant and cafe owners.  This is useful for people in general to see how adopting BitcoinCash can be a way to enable innovation and deliver a nice retail experience.

The second deliverable is the actual software to run the retail experience : so a vendor can on-board from the concept video to taking BitcoinCash orders in their business as quickly and easily as possible.  This is based on existing moosh.io wallet and point-of-sale feature set, augmented to handle a customer browsing the menu and self-ordering.

After the project, others can refer vendors and retailers to #BitcoinCashLatte site and video - as a quick intro to BitcoinCash for business, and to specific solutions.  Marketing can scale up after the fact, and salespeople can use it to sell/demo these services to retailers in their local area.  Customers can email or tweet the link to businesses they would like to adopt BCH locally, etc.

Having a visual, clear, step-by-step template to retail adoption - coupled with working software - will accelerate the uptake of BitcoinCash as a currency in the real world.


**Other:**

- https://moosh.io : instant web wallet and point of sale
- developer links : quantblog.wordpress.com, reddit.com/u/justgord

The longterm business model of moosh.io is a 0.2% fee on Orders, but the wallet is free for normal send/recv usage. 
 
Substantial development has already taken place on moosh.io taking it to the stage where it is a working release - and prototype code exists for barcode scanning, and mobile UX.   #BitcoinCashLatte will help promote moosh.io indirectly, but this is in proportion to the voluntary time spent adding extra features to moosh to support the retail experience demo.

BCF will see the storyboard and other Milestones and thus have oversight to ensure that the #BitcoinCashLatte project can be an effective promotion for all BitcoinCash retail solutions.   eg. Other wallets will feature in the video to make it clear that customers can pay with any wallet that supports BitcoinCash etc.

I think the combination of open-source and commercial interest has a lot of potential to scale BitcoinCash adoption .. I know a lot of devs have volunteered time and enjoy doing so, but ultimately we need to explore hybrid business models that are sustainable long term.   Small investments/donations for projects like this help accelerate adoption and get innovation happening - thanks for the BCF initiative !
