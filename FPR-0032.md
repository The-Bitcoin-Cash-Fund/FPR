**Project Name:**
Uptate QR code spec to support smart contracts

**FPR Id:**
0032

**Start Date:**
25/02/2018

**Hashtag:**
#BCHSmartContracts

**Name of BCF Gitter community room:**
#proj-uptateQrCodeSpecToSupportSmartContracts

**Stakeholders:**

**Project Summary:**
I am working on an updated specification to BIP0020/21 to allow QR codes and URLs to generate smart contracts that can be read and sent by any SPV wallet. 
The spec supports setting up large multi-output transactions and generating a URL that a wallet can use to set up a multi-output or scripted transaction.


**Resources:**
I specifically need people knowledgeable on how the current Bitcoin URI is handled including wallet and POS makers. It would also be good to have some of the BCH node developers on-board to review also.
The current version of the spec is posted at https://github.com/the-beer-engineer/SmartURI
This will define how quickly BCH can spread smart contracts to all users. The most valuable commodity is time spent reviewing, commenting and engaging with wallet makers and POS makers to ensure that they are onboard.

**Budget:**
$0 at this stage to just get the spec out

Next goal is to build both a wallet and a POS to demonstrate. This could easily be achieved with help from the Electron Cash team however they have been fairly silent on any review requests I have made. I would probably it would cost $50k-80k and need 2 developers for 1-2 months. 


**Timeline:**
Close review and submit as final version by April 1 2018
Team start work same day
3 weeks for first live demo
6-8 weeks for full integration with Electron Cash (I could be way off here).

**Goals:**
I want to revolutionise how people understand and use smart contracts. The biggest hurdle for most people is to use one. Once they have done that a lot of the uncertainty will disappear. We need a way to ensure that smart contracts are easy and fast for anyone to use every day. Making it possible to send them using existing methods that people are familiar with is super important. 

**Other:**
It will only work if everyone is onboard.
