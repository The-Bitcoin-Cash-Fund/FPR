**Project Summary:**
A slick, high production quality video, explaining 0 conf transactions and the benefit of using BCH at merchants.

**Resources:**
I have already sourced all of this and am highly skilled myself. When filming the video we will have a camera man, actors, and also staff at a merchant where I perform a BCH transaction for goods.

**Budget:**
While some costs have already been paid for by me personally, in order to push this project forward quickly, I will list them here.

Production Costs: 
Film and editing: $4,000 AUD
Pre-production: $1,550 AUD



**Timeline:**
Pre-produciton process has already been completed. Filming this Sunday, 6/05/2018. Will edit and release the video in the following week. 

**Goals:**
I want to reach users of Bitcoin who are brainwashed into thinking SegWit coin is the real version of Bitcoin, as described in the Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto. In addition to that, I will be aiming to appease to normies who are not currently invested in crypto, or who have only basic knowledge (they don&#39;t know about the corporate takeover of Bitcoin branding).

If BCH Fund wants to fund this project, I wish to keep the rights to publish this video on my own channels. Roger Ver and others will help me promote it, but I want to grow in this community as an individua - not as a colectivel. If you would like to discuss this further, please contact me on Twitter or Discord.
