#proj-bitcoinCashTourVenezuela

**Stakeholders:**
Me: Luis Troconis and Luis Cardona

**Project Summary:**
A project to educate about bitcoin cash

**Resources:**
First of all, a group of lecturers. 
It will take everything that is pop material.
And logistical resources. 

**Budget:**
In fact, to do something good and stable, I would need about 3,000 dollars to go around the 24 states of the country, and above all to make the conferences free, and to find the places where I give them bitcoin cash, so that they can start accepting them in their establishments. And the date for which I would need them would be August 9, 2018, so that I could manage the places and pay in advance. But the important thing is that they approve it, whatever the date. Of course, before the year is out. 

**Timeline:**
August 15, 2018 until December 10, 2018

**Goals:**
First of all it is the idea of creating a Bitcoin Cash Venezuela Academy, where all those entrepreneurs come to us for advice or who want to invest in BCH in one way or another. Also, to devise ways to help the Venezuelan population, since it has been quite affected by the economic pattern. I mean, helping those Venezuelans who are going through a situation. I believe that with this project we can reach too many people, because it is a global project with a view to expanding internationally.  I want to reach out to them, because I feel that it is my duty as a citizen and as an entrepreneur to get involved in cryptomoney, and I also love this project and I believe that many things can be done. 

**Other:**
I would like to form a kind of Bitcoin Cash Proposal Venezuela or Bitcoin Cash Fund Venezuela.
