## Use S.M.A.R.T Principles When writing the BCF FPR

**S** - **Specific** - Well defined. Clear to anyone that has a basic knowledge of the project

**M** - **Measurable** - Know if the goal is obtainable. Find out when you have achieved your goal

**A** - **Agreed Upon** - Agreement with all the stakeholders what the goals should be.

**R** - **Realistic** - Within the availability of resources, knowledge and time.

**T** - **Time-bound** - Enough time to achieve the goal. Not too much time, which can affect project performance


## BCF FPR Requirements

- A completed FPR must be included as to a project's github repo as the first commit/PR as an md file. This will help guide the project, and anyone who joins it can quickly find out the most important information.
- Any print media the BCF funds with either dimension over 40mm must have the BCF round logo on it somewhere.
- Any print media the BCF funds with either dimension over 100mm must have the logos of our Tier 3 sponsors on it somewhere.
- Any video projects the BCF funds must include the BCF Bitcoin Cash animation at the beginning or end of the video.
- Any video projects the BCF funds must include our tier 2 and tier 3 sponsors at the end of the video.
- The BCF reserves the right to not fund any project at it's own discretion.

## What isn't the Bitcoin Cash Fund for.

- Funds will not be given to companies just to further their business. Companies are welcome to submit an FPR as long as it is for a specific project that attempts to directly increase awareness and adoption of Bitcoin Cash.
- Funds will not be paid to individuals or businesses simply because they want money.
- Funds will not be paid for BCH protocol development (at this time).
