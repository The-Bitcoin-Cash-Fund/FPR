About Ben Swann

I have 20 years of experience in journalism, behind and in front of the camera. I became drawn to covering under-reported issues and events early on in my career, particularly during my time covering the drug war in Mexico when I realized that the war on drugs was being misrepresented and most mainstream media had no interest in upholding their commitment to sharing the truth with the public. I’ve received two Emmy awards and two Edward R. Murrow awards, as well as several AP awards from my time in Texas and New Mexico.

Over the past few months I have drawn considerable attention to Dash Digital Cash by promoting Dash’s decentralization of media through our sponsorship. A half dozen other independent media entities have now approached either Dash our other treasury cryptos with similar proposals.

I am not new to the cryptocurrency community. I’ve been discussing Bitcoin since 2013, longer and more thoroughly than most journalists in the media, in my own reporting as well as during my appearance at the Texas Bitcoin Conference in 2014. My experience stands in contrast to the majority of mainstream media, which is scrambling to catch up on coverage largely because cryptocurrency has become so accessible and attractive that they can no longer ignore it. However, the majority of media corporations fail to objectively and accurately report on this industry.

Benefit to Bitcoin Cash

We have the ability to promote Bitcoin Cash before a diverse and liberty oriented audeince.  Reality Check episodes dive into subjects that are embraced and heavily recirculated by an enormous and diverse crowd. This crowd comes from widely varying political, social and geographic backgrounds and they range from individuals who have spent a great deal of their own time on research to individuals who are learning about these subjects for the first time, and the subject of cryptocurrency is no exception. The promotion of Bitcoin Cash will fit seamlessly with our reporting: while our audience is diverse, it shares a common passion for disruption in the media as well as a mindset that embraces disruptive technologies like cryptocurrency.

We have the advantage of both a huge audience and existing experience in speaking to the public about cryptocurrency. Using the same footprint that has helped Reality Check and Truth In Media episodes reach hundreds of millions of viewers, we will be able to integrate Bitcoin Cash within our videos as well as bring those topics to live events at a more intimate level with the public. Our team is ready to pick up where we left off, and we will work closely with Bitcoin Cash to develop and execute a successful BCH branding strategy for events, video and other content.

Project updates to be expected by the community

Projected Timeline:

Starting in July 2018.


Even though we had more &quot;yes&quot; votes for renewal with DASH than any other project, DASH has a weighted system that gives no votes more &quot;value&quot; which has left us just under the threshold for funding. 


“I believe that in the future the ‘COIN’ or ‘CURRENCY’ we use will be a consumer choice. Just like we either choose products like Ray Ban or Gucci. Marketing and branding will play a huge part and DASH seem to be the leaders at this and have embraced it. From a trading point of view, I also make a lot of money from DASH. Its a coin that repeats its cycle over and over so not only do I get to long term hold but I can play the waves and take the profits on the way. I also love their sponsorship program that helps amazing causes like Ben Swann Truth in media…” - Scott Daniel Oceans Capital

**Resources:**
Our team of writers, researchers, production and marketing gurus know how to create the strongest product possible.  We have also been successful at promoting Dash through our content at a time when Facebook, Google, YouTube and Twitter have all instituted bans on crypto advertising.  The Bitcoin Cash brand is already stronger than Dash and would, in our opinion, be a great fit with our Reality Check and Sponsor Spotlight content.

**Budget:**
Budget for 6 months- 400 BCH per month

Covers funding for July/August/September/October/November/December

Marketing team and marketing budget

Researchers, writers, producers, executive producer

Production Crew (Audio operator, Director, Videographers, Engineers, Video Editors, Video Animator)

Graphic Designers 12,000 Legal/Insurance

Office/Admistrative Costs

Travel  

**Timeline:**
Timeline for project begins July 2nd, 2018 with new episodes released every Monday and Wednesday of July, August, September, October, November, December

BCH Sponsor Spotlight will begin Sunday, July 8, 2018 and will release every Sunday through December, 2018.

Weekly Crypto show will begin Thursday, July 5th and will release every Thursday through December of 2018

**Goals:**
Our goal is to continue the momentum we have built with the Dash sponsorship. Reality Check /w Ben Swann powered by Dash Digital Cash has received over 20 million videos since just February of this year.   We expect to see continued growth from month to month as our average view per video on Facebook alone is 500,000.  Every report we release also appears in the trending section of Dtube.  In addition, we believe that our crypto news content will do extremely well with large numbers of crypto sites looking to supplement video content. 



**Other:**
Reality Check w/Ben Swann has brought massive awareness to the public of Dash Digital Cash&#39;s DAO system as well as treasury system.  We have helped to encourage DASH adoption through our branding initiatives.  We believe that a sponsor relationship with Bitcoin Cash would provide great brand recognition for BCH as well as encourage quicker adoption.
