**Timeline:**
Once the van and trailer is acquired and wrapped, all the arrangements for the tech and promo material can be ordered, and received with in days. The solar panel can be fitted (by me) in less than a day.
Hopefully May 21st would be the start date and start traveling and vlogging the trip, daily. Editing the days footage in the evening.
I have backpacked around asia, and am well used to living on the road.
I have no children, no family, just me and the dogs, and that is why I feel I can really help promote BHC on a long term tour of the UK.

**Goals:**
Mass adoption, the next 2 years is (in my opinion) going to be the make or brake of crypto coins, I believe that BHC is the real BITCOIN, and is for-filling Natoshi&#96;s whitepaper to the real world. 
BHC sat withstood everything from &quot;scam&quot; to &quot;Judas&quot; and has held its head high.
I hope to bring BHC to the man in the street, if i fail , it will not be because i did not try hard enough, once people understand how together we can change the whole world for the benefit of our brothers and sisters in this global family.

**Other:**
I want no ownership of any of the items, no wages, no financial gain, just costs covered, so I will have no income tax issues, I am donating my time in exchange for living costs,  used items after the project finishers January 2020, will be left to the foundation to decide to, sell, donate or use in future promotions.
