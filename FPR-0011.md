# ![BCF Logo Round Tiny](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/The-Bitcoin-Cash-Fund/Branding/master/BCF%20Symbol%20Round%20Tiny.png) BCF Funding Proposal Request Template


**Project Name:** Santacoin


**Start Date:** 08.12.17


**Hashtag:** #Santacoin


**Name of BCF Chat room:** Santacoin


**Stakeholders:** 

Paul Wasensteiner  
Gabriele Wasensteiner


**Project Summary:** 

Santacon event is an event in London where thousands of people dress up as Santa Claus and march around the streets of London, talking and meeting new people on the way. The concept for the project is to create a large number of paper tip wallets, fund them with a couple of $ worth of Bitcoin Cash, then hand them out at the event.

The first thing to do is to design a double-sided page of paper tip wallets (12 on each page). The tip wallet will contain simple instructions how to use them to access the BCH on them. They will contain a QR code to download the bitcoin.com wallet, a QR code for the public and private key, and the public and private key written out as text.  
  
The template for the page will be designed in CorelDraw, and the cashaddress.org website will be used to generate the pub-priv key pairs. The cashaddress.org website will be downloaded to be used offline. All creation of the wallets will be completed offline. Then once they have been printed the files will be deleted from the system and the computer will be turned off and restarted before reconnecting it to the internet (for security).  
  
The pages will be produced and printed off by Paul, then cut up and funded by Gabriele.  
  
The wallets will then be handed out to other members of the Santacon and the public as presents.


**Resources:**

- Graphic design skills,
- Two people two cut up and send BCH to the wallets.
- Plain paper,
- Printer,
- Someone trustworthy to hand them out at the event.


**Budget:**

$1000 to make 500 wallets with $2 on each wallet.  

Funds will need to be paid to a separate wallet in one go so that we do not need to make 500 multisid payment proposals.


**Timeline:** 

08.12.17 - Produce the paper tip wallets.  
09.12.17 - Hand the paper tip wallets out.


**Goals:**

- Aiming to reach young people in London.
- Potentially 500 people directly and 1000 people indirectly.
- It will be easy to interact with large numbers of young people at Santacon because it is a large social event, loosely associated with giving.
- Only hand out wallets to people who I interact with directly, to at very least explain what Bitcoin Cash is and what the piece of paper is.


**Other:**

Paper wallets will not be given out to more than one person at a time directly. Attention will be paid to who is giving them out. Wallets will be secured by Paul and Gaby on the day so that not all wallets are held by just one person.  
  
Private keys will be stored and put into a program to automatically take back the funds back that haven't been spent within 30 days.
