**Project Name:** Bitcoin Cash Tutorial Series


**Start Date:** December 5, 2017


**Hashtag:** #bchtuts


**Name of BCF Chat room:** proj-Tutorial-Series


**Stakeholders:**

**Project Summary:** 

A series of 10 tutorials covering tools in the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. Each will come as text and video. People who enjoy going at their own pace can read the written form and people who want to kick back can watch the video. Tutorials will be published on Yours.org and have a YouTube video embedded. 

I will write the tutorials in a similar style to the tutorial I published on [Submitting a Bitcoin Cash Fund (BCF) Project Proposal with GitHub](https://www.yours.org/content/tutorial--submitting-a-bitcoin-cash-fund--bcf--project-proposal-with-g-5474a844b9b2).

I will keep all of the published tutorials on the [Bitcoin Cash Tutorial Series: List](https://www.yours.org/content/bitcoin-cash-tutorial-series--list-d7110d57908d).

Each tutorial is a fundraising opportunity for whichever tool I’m demonstrating. So for example, when I publish an Electron Cash tutorial, I will donate any tips I receive on that tutorial to Electron Cash. With this tutorial series, we are helping seed the Bitcoin Cash ecosystem. 

**Resources:**

* Make a bullet point plan about what to cover in the tutorial
* Write the content
* Capture the screenshots
* Annotate the screenshots
* Tech edit pass
* English edit pass
* Final pass edit on written content
* Record the video
* Edit the video (remove dead spots, add intro/outro)
* Final pass edit on video
* Upload the video to YouTube
* Add the meta data on the video
* Embed the video into the written tutorial
* Publish the tutorial on Yours
* Tweet it

**Budget:**

To get a feel for the market value of publishing tutorials, here’s a real-world example. The most popular iOS tutorials website is http://raywenderlich.com. 

The payment schedule for http://raywenderlich.com single written tutorials is:

* Writing: $400
* Tech edit: $100
* Edit $75
* Final pass edit: $100
* Platinum authors: +$100/post
—
Writing total: $775

The payment schedule for http://raywenderlich.com video series is:

* 10 videos (12 weeks deadline): $5,000
* Exceeds expectations bonus: +$50/video
* On time bonus: +$50/video
* Edit: $100/video
—
Video total: $700

Keep in mind that I will be making both a written and a video tutorial. That means there will be more involved than making only the written portion or only the video portion. There is some economy of scale since the content is shared, but there is also a lot of effort involved in working through all the steps. In any case, given the numbers above, $700 is right for a well done tutorial. 

Projects supported by The Bitcoin Cash Fund thrive mostly from volunteer effort. I would like to give a 70% discount on my labor. This means that my tutorial fee will be 30% of the market rate:

$700 * 0.3 = $210

In Season One, I will produce 10 tutorials:

$210 * 10 = $2100

So for Season One, the first 10 tutorials in the series, $2100 is the budget.


**Timeline:** 

I will deliver at least one tutorial per week, starting December 11, 2017, with the goal to surprise and delight by delivering at a more frequent cadence.

**Goals:**

The goal of this effort is to reach beginners and provide shareable content. The more people who know how to use tools in the ecosystem, the stronger the Bitcoin Cash community will be. By donating tips for each tool on each tutorial, we are also helping to encourage further development of these tools and gathering valuble feedback about their user experience.
