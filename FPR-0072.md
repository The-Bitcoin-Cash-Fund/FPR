Bitcoin Cash Magazine

**FPR Id:**
0072

**Start Date:**

**Project Summary:**
Bitcoin Cash Magazine is a free online magazine promoting Bitcoin Cash through opinionated articles, beginner guides and information, latest developments, entertainment, contentious issues, new services and merchants, interviews with interesting or influential community members and some general news.

Bitcoin Cash Magazine (refered to hereafter as &quot;Bitcoincashmag&quot;) can be found at https://bitcoincashmag.com

The &quot;Bitcoin Magazine&quot; found at https://bitcoinmagazine.com is not a Bitcoin Cash friendly publication and rarely covers developments related to Bitcoin Cash. It also uses the name &quot;Bcash&quot; to refer to Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoincashmag is not a news website and won&#39;t be the latest source of cryptocurrency news. That has been done enough. It&#39;s an entertainment magazine mostly consisting of editorials (opinions from community members) on various news and developments related to Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoincashmag is a non-profit magazine and the purpose is promoting Bitcoin Cash. Though the purpose of Bitcoincashmag is to promote Bitcoin Cash we will also publish dissenting opinions from contributors (such as &quot;BTC is the real Bitcoin and here is why...&quot;) to provide balanced arguments to our readers.

**Resources:**
What we have

Bitcoincashmag has a website (https://bitcoincashmag.com) where the publication will be released and social media accounts. It has one editor (Diamondcityradio) who is also the project manager.

What we need

The resources we require are a team to manage the magazine (refered to hereafter as &quot;Editors&quot;). The team should consist of community members interested in contributing some of their spare time and knowledge to promoting Bitcoin Cash through managing articles for Bitcoincashmag releases. 

We also require contributors (refered to hereafter as &quot;Writers&quot;) who are interested in sharing their opinions for publication in Bitcoincashmag releases.

Summary

The Editors will be owners of the magazine and the Writers will be freelance contributors (not necessary experienced writers as we want to encourage opinions from regular community members). The Editors would own a &quot;stake&quot; in the magazine while the writers would be offered publicity and free advertising for their social media accounts or websites for readers to follow them.

Bitcoincashmag is non-profit and all contributors, editors and writers will volunteer for the magazine. Though the magazine uses volunteer contributors, we would consider paying certain writers for expert or technical analysis or well researched contributions.

What this model provides

This model lets Bitcoincashmag bring in writers with a wide range of knowledge, experiences and opinions. It gives a voice to the unheard, as anyone with an opinion and an understanding or involvement in cryptocurrencies can write for our magazine. It does not become an &quot;echo chamber&quot; or corporate business but rather a community centered publication.

Bitcoincashmag is a purely digital non-profit and can operate without the crushing overheads that often topple young startup companies.

**Budget:**
Funding

The project does not require initial funding from the BCF because most costs will be met by the project manager (diamondcityradio). It may be judged that some funds are required at a later time for marketing or expansion though no commitment to future funding is requested.

What we need

What this project requires from the BCF is assistance with helping to assemble a team of volunteers and contributors for the magazine as well as helping and advising on how to setup a Discord channel and best practice for the early stages of project management so we can build the foundation.

Summary

No commitment to future funding is requested. We do need help to assemble a team of volunteer editors and writers for the magazine.

**Timeline:**
This is a brief timeline of the projected events related to Bitcoincashmag.

4th May 2018

- Team of editors and writers is assembled.

- Discussions begin with everyone involved in the project on Discord.

- Issue 1 development of the magazine begins.

24th June

- Bitcoin Cash Magazine, development of Issue 1 is completed.

- Issue 1 is reviewed and finishing touches are made.

1st July

- Issue 1 of Bitcoin Cash Magazine is released.

The magazine will then be released on a monthly basis.

**Goals:**
Goal 1

Establish a team of editors to manage the magazine. This consists of people interested in volunteering some spare time to collaborate on the project organization. 

Establish a team (or &quot;pool&quot;) of writers and contributors for the magazine who can provide their thoughts and opinions which can be written into articles or editorials.

Goal 2

Produce a magazine which entertains, educates and informs readers about Bitcoin Cash.

Goal 3

Reach the target audience through social media. Build a following for the magazine through engagement with the cryptocurrency community.

Readers can be added to an email list to be informed when the latest issue is released.

Target audience

The target demographic is:

- Males and females aged around 18-36
- College students, young graduates, young working professionals
- Interest in cryptocurrencies
- Less than 2 years experience with cryptocurrencies

Though anyone can read and be entertained by Bitcoincashmag we concentrate on this demographic when writing content so that the magazine is beginner friendly and easy to understand.



**Other:**
Bitcoincashmag can be represented at future events and be used as a platform to launch and advertise new merchants and services for Bitcoin Cash. This can make Bitcoincashmag an important community resource for readers to discover and read reviews about new and interesting developments for Bitcoin Cash.

Bitcoincashmag does not require funding but does require the help and assistance of BCF to setup the foundations of the magazine. The project manager (Diamondcityradio) can cover expenses but does not have the experience and knowledge to build this project on his own. 

It&#39;s for this reason that the help of BCF is requested.

Thank you for reading this proposal.
