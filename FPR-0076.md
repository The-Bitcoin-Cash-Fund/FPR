We need an approximate financing of 150 or $ 165, we do not ask you to finance us with all our project, since we plan to raise funds using all the money we will raise with our publications and we will buy food for the people who need it, those who do not have to eat and are in the street situation, as well as the necessary costs for compliance and the development of our project.

Any contribution or financing will be very useful to fulfill our dream and the project of collaborating with the most needy people, those who need help.

**Timeline:**
With the money collected first we will go to buy the necessary utensils for the elaboration of food as well as the food that will be prepared later.

We will carry out the feeding sessions two to three times a week in a first stage, although we dream of being able to do them in the near future every day everything will depend on the impulse and economic collaboration towards our foundation.

These feeding days will be held in the places most frequented by people of limited resources in our state, trying to go every day to a different place to eat so that the food can reach a greater number of people.

It is important to note that each step we take will be documented and uploaded in reports to our communication network (Yours.org) since we want to be as transparent as possible.
