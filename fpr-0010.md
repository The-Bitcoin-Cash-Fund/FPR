# BCF Funding Proposal Request Template


**Project Name:** wherebitcoins.trade


**Start Date:** December 5, 2017


**Hashtag:** #bchmap


**Name of BCF Chat room:** #bchmap


**Stakeholders:**

http://github.com/placer14 - Project Management/Fullstack/Devops

**Project Summary:**

Users currently have nowhere to find local merchants, private individuals willing to barter, or even local places to trade, discuss, and use certain (future?) features of Bitcoin Cash.

This project will produce an interactive Map which allows Individuals to indicate specific physical addresses where Bitcoin Cash is used. Any connected individual which has access to Bitcoin Cash should be able to interact with this website with no extra cost to the User.

**Resources:**

- 1 or 2 developers to cover the following skillsets:
  - UI development (javscript?)
  - API development (ruby/go?)
  - devops management (site build pipeline, github pages/cloudfront handling)
- monthly infrastructure overhead (approx $15/mo to start)

**Budget:**

- wherebitcoins.trade TLD domain name: $5 for 5 years (donated/purchased)
- hosting costs: $10/mo (donated during development)
- development hours: 40 hours over two-four weeks for $2,500 (50% time donated)

**Timeline:**

MVP soft launch in 2 weeks. Tweak to launch in 4 weeks.


**Goals:**

The interactive Map will provide the following behavior:

- A User can claim a Position on the Map.
- A Position will include an associated set of data which may be maintained by the Claiming User which must include:
  - a non-unique pair of latitude and longitude coordinates
  - at minimum 1 Claiming User

- The Website homepage will be a fullscreen Map which shows aggregate Positions geospatially oriented by their coordinates.
- Users may register an Account which maintains their right of Claim over a Position.
- Users may share the right of Claim over a Position with another Account.
- Users may relinquish their right of Claim over a Position as long as one other Claiming User exists.
- Website will be designed with modern desktop and mobile browser experiences in mind and will make reasonable effort to support the wide range of browsing clients, however priority will be given to Chrome, Firefox and Safari.

Future features may be added based on community support. Ideas include:

- Easily share Positions in Social Media
- Advanced Search
- Categorize Positions
- User-defined, structured metadata associated with Positions
- API (index, search, etc)
- Native mobile clients
- Position/User reputation/reviews
